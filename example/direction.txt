    dynamic task
    code restructuring:
            Level	Ask This Question	Action in DSL
        1. Goal-level	Does this field express mission goals?	✅ Expose it
        2. Control-level	Does this field tune how the drone behaves?	⚠️ Abstract with modes
        3. Mechanism-level	Does this field configure low-level mechanisms?	❌ Hide or auto-calculate

        allow overrides:
          track = Track:
            class  = person
            model  = coco
            mode   = aggressive

            advanced:
                descent_speed = 8
                yaw_speed     = 120


code optimization:
    python algo: loop unrolling, if condition removing
    control flow graph

debugger:
    ideal drone execute engine
    read the drone cap and registration file
    compilation checking (static analysis)
    static + dynamic analysis

LLM training:
    compiler could report in a way that help llm to understand


HCI:
